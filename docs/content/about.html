<div class="text">
    <p>why hello there, it seems like you have reached my about page. i guess it's time to tell you a little bit about myself. that's usually how these things work. </p>
    <p>my name is clef (or at least, my online name is. if you're this deep into my personal website you probably already know my real name). you may also see me online as altoclef or clefalto. i am a computer science student getting my bachelor's degree at an unspecified university in California! wow! no way!</p>
    <p>i tend to occupy my time with the most Productive things imaginable, such as developing video games, PLAYING video games (not necessarily the developed ones), THINKING about video games, watching shows, applying for internships <img src="/assets/images/depressed.jpg" alt=":(" style="width:17px;height:17px">, listening to music, cooking, and other extremely useful and fun things </p>
    <br>
    <p>this site is simply a collection of my various work and <span class="inline-link"><a href="/projects">Creations</a></span>. right now it doesn't look like much, i am learning HTML and CSS and JavaScript and Ruby and Liquid as i make this website so things get done very slowly and inefficiently. this site was made with jekyll and just <i>a few</i> w3schools tutorials</p>
    <p>just please, please don't inspect element</p>
    <p>all jokes aside, i appreciate you taking the time to look through my Masterpieces! even getting this far is awesome! hopefully you leave enlightened</p>
